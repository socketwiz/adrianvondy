                <p>
                    There are certain occasions when Virginia law requires the appointment
                    of another person to look after the interests of a person who is incapable
                    of making decisions due to a mental or psychological impairment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a loved one is unable to make decisions concerning personal care or
                    finances, a court proceeding should be initiated to appoint a guardian
                    to make that person’s personal and medical decisions, and/or a conservator
                    to manage the person’s financial affairs.
                </p>
